# Survey_Project

This project is Youtube, in which he, a data analyst covers a real-life task for which he received payment and so the main purpose of completing this project is to show knowledge of the skills present in this video. 


This project consists of an initial data source, which is stored in an Excel file called data.xlsx, the file that contains my code, which is called Script1, and the final Excel file contains the final version of the data which is stored in my file. 


Knowing Python beforehand, I challenged myself to complete the code on my own before verifying if my code produced the correct information. The crucial information I learned and my notes of the code are included in the code file.
